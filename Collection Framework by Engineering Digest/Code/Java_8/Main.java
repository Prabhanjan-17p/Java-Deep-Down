        ✅ What is Java 8?
        Java 8 is a major release of the Java programming language introduced by Oracle in March 2014.
        It brought functional programming features and modern APIs to simplify coding, improve performance, and
        support parallel processing.

        🔍 Why Java 8 was Introduced?
        java 8 was introduced to solve problems such as:
            🔁 Boilerplate code in anonymous classes
            🧵 Poor parallelism and complex thread management
            ⏳ Outdated Date & Time APIs (Date, Calendar were error-prone)
            🛠️ Lack of functional-style programming in Java
            🚫 Frequent NullPointerException issues without safety mechanisms

        ⚙️ Major Features of Java 8
            ✅ Lambda Expressions – Enables concise anonymous functions
            ✅ Functional Interfaces – Interface with a single abstract method
            ✅ Stream API – Efficient data processing (filter, map, reduce)
            ✅ Date & Time API – Immutable and thread-safe time handling
            ✅ Optional Class – To handle nulls gracefully
            ✅ Default & Static methods in interfaces
            ✅ Nashorn JavaScript Engine for executing JS inside Java
