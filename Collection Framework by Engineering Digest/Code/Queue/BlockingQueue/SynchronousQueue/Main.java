        ‚úÖ What is SynchronousQueue?
        -------------------------------------
        - A thread-safe queue with **zero capacity**.
        - Does NOT store elements ‚Äî every `put()` must wait for a `take()`, and vice versa.
        - Designed for **direct handoff** between threads.

        ‚ùì Why it was introduced:
        -------------------------------------
        - Traditional queues (e.g., ArrayBlockingQueue) buffer data temporarily.
        - Some applications need **real-time coordination**: producer should not continue unless consumer is ready.

        ‚ö†Ô∏è The Issue:
        -------------------------------------
        - In systems like task executors or handoff pipelines, we need **immediate delivery** of data.
        - Buffered queues introduce latency and resource use (memory).

        üîß The Fix ‚Äì SynchronousQueue:
        -------------------------------------
        - Solves the issue by forcing synchronization between producer and consumer.
        - Ensures tight coupling (synchronous behavior).
        - Commonly used in:
            ‚û§ ThreadPoolExecutor (using `Executors.newCachedThreadPool()`)
            ‚û§ Real-time communication tasks
